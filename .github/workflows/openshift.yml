# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.
